## Inspiration
In coding interviews, we need to write codes in google docs but it can't do auto-formatting nor it can run the program. So I wanted to create an alternative where we can write codes as we do in a normal compiler.

## What it does
It connects users from different locations using different devices to connect through its website and write and share their respective codes.

## What's next for this project
1. I will add a mic feature through which users can talk to each other.
2.  Add a feature to compile and run the code in different languages.
